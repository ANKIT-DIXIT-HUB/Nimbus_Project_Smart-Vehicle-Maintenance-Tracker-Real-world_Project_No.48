# Nimbus_Project_Smart-Vehicle-Maintenance-Tracker-Real-world_Project_No.48
📌 Overview

The Smart Vehicle Maintenance Tracker is a C-based mini-project designed to help fleet managers monitor vehicle health, track service records, and get timely maintenance alerts.
It uses structures, functions, arrays, pointers, and dynamic memory — aligning perfectly with academic requirements and real-world fleet management systems.

🎯 Project Objectives

The system allows users to:

1.Record vehicle number, mileage, and last service date

2.Estimate next service date/mileage based on average daily usage

3.Generate alerts for overdue services

4.Maintain dynamic, expandable records using pointers

5.Provide reports using arrays and functions

🧩 Features

✔️ Add new vehicle records
✔️ Predict next service using mileage + avg usage
✔️ Overdue alerts using date difference
✔️ Dynamic storage using malloc/realloc
✔️ Modular code (4 headers + 4 source files)
✔️ Hinglish commented code (student-friendly)
